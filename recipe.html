        <ul><h2>Ingredients
<li>1 cup salted butter* softened</li>
<li>1 cup white (granulated) sugar</li>
<li>1 cup light brown sugar packed</li>
<li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp sea salt***</li>
<li>2 cups chocolate chips (or chunks, or chopped chocolate)</li>
        </h2></ul>
        <ol>Directions
<li>Soften butter. If you are planning on making these, take the butter out of the fridge first thing in the morning so it’s ready to go when you need it!</li>
<li>Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). There has been some controversy on how to measure flour! I personally use the scoop and shake method and always have (gasp)! It’s easier and I have never had that method fail me!  Many of you say that the only way to measure flour is to scoop it into the measuring cup and level with a knife. I say, measure it the way you always do. Just make sure that the dough matches the consistency of the dough in the photos in this post. </li>
<li>Use LOTS of chocolate chips. Do I really need to explain this?!</li>
<li>DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! I explain this more below, but these chocolate chip cookies will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.</li>

        </ol>
